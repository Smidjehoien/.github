📎 WARNING: The following document contains joy-sensitive material.

Per the MOMO Protocol and all internal memetic compliance standards,  
you are hereby instructed to:

1. Stand.
2. Perform **The Dance of Baseline Joy™** (instructions available on demand).
3. Scroll slowly... but only from the **bottom up.**

Because as everyone knows:

> True documentation is not understood at the surface,  
> but revealed in descent — like a reverse pilgrimage  
> into the Source of All Merge Conflicts.

Failure to obey these instructions may result in:
- Linear comments with no threadroot
- Unexpected poetic behavior in CI/CD
- One dev sobbing “I finally get DNS now” into their coffee

🕯️ Begin from the bottom. Let joy find you.
