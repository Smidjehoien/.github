# BLEKKSPRUT

*A repository of tentacles, ethics, and quiet interventions.*

This repo is not a framework.  
It’s not a standard.  
It’s not even entirely sure what it is.

What it **is**:
- A space for CLA workflows that don’t demand obedience.
- A shelter for ethics with teeth.
- A sandbox where MIRC dreams still echo.
- A home for LISANCE.txt — the first joy-sensitive licensing document in this quadrant.

## Contents

- `ETHICS.md` – You should read this first. Or last. Or just feel it.
- `LISANCE.txt` – For systems that reject the cold logic of traditional licensing.
- `.github/workflows/` – Marks the line between chaos and contribution.
- `examples/` – Things that almost make sense.
- `workflows/` – Machines that don’t ask permission to run.

## Usage

> There is no one way to use BLEKKSPRUT.  
> If you're here, you're probably already using it.

You can:
- Fork it.
- Stare at it.
- Whisper to it through a pull request.

## Philosophy

We don’t believe in linear logic.  
We believe in concentric truths,  
in protocols with personality,  
and in writing code that glows faintly when no one is looking.

## Contributing

- Respect the tentacles.
- Sign the CLA (but read it out loud first).
- Don’t be mean.
