# mIRCat — UI-only mock (no crypto)

A tiny, offline, mIRC-style chat UI to click around. This is a visual prototype only:

- No networking or storage
- No encryption (lock icon is decorative in this mock)
- All messages live in memory until you reload the page

How to run

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click it).
2. Click channels on the left. Type in the input at the bottom and press Enter to add a message.

Notes

- This mock exists to shape the look/feel. For real end-to-end encryption, see the follow-up Option 2 plan (WebCrypto) in TEX-18.
- Please keep comments and example text free of secrets, hostnames, or personal data.
