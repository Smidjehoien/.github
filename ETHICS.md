# Ethics & Responsible Use

This repository adopts a simple, explicit clause to keep work benevolent, consent‑driven, and non‑targeting.

## Non‑targeting & benevolence

- We do not monitor, profile, or attempt to “catch” people. Participation is voluntary and opt‑in.
- Prefer non‑action over risky or ambiguous action; escalate to a human reviewer.
- Never collect or infer sensitive traits; avoid PII entirely.
- Help is offered quietly and with consent; publish only anonymized, reusable guidance (no names, no specifics).
- No scraping of gated/paid content and no attempts to bypass DRM or rate limits.

## Posture & scope

- Default posture: conservative. If a step isn’t clearly helpful and consented, we don’t take it.
- Data minimization: keep logs generic and short‑lived; do not store secrets in this repo or CI logs.
- Offline‑first: prefer offline/simulated runs; any user‑visible or external action must be explicitly approved by a human reviewer.
